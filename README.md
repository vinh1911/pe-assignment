# Pi.Ex Assignment [[Live Demo]](https://pe-assignment.vercel.app/)

Unfotunately I had a busy week so I can only spend my weekends for this projects. Roughly 8hrs of coding time.

My main focus while developing this was the structure of the project.

It is inspired by Nx's scaleable monorepo style architeture and I leveraged the new Standalone Component to shift from a standard Module focused Angular app to a Component/Feature focused one.

I tried to make my code declarative with async pipe, rxjs, component-store for a simple and clean code so I didn't comment on my code much.

## If I had more time / What I would add

Virtual inifite scroll on the GIFs list or some kind of pagination, currently it only load 50 gifs.

Add unit test and e2e test

Improve the GIFs grid css so that the space is closer (Masonry grid)

Error handling, 404.html, Route Guard, etc....

Styling in general i guess
